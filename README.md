# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

In my position as a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, I have been asked to create an analysis of the ride-sharing data by city type and present my findings in a multi-line chart visualizing total weekly fares by city type. 

### Results

* Suburban and urban cities have five to thirteen times more total number of riders than rural cities, respectively.

* Rural cities have 412 to 2,327 less drivers than suburban and urban cities, respectively.

* Urban and suburban cities generate 9 to 5 times more money in fares than rural cities.
* Rural city riders are paying $4 to $10 more per ride than suburban and urban city riders, respectively.
* Rural city drivers are making $2 to $3 more per ride than suburban and urban city drivers, respectively.

* Urban cities make more in fares weekly due to the increased number of drivers available in urban areas.

#### Summary

Based on this analysis, some recommendations to address the diparaties between city types would be:
1. Increase the number of drivers in rural cities.  This may encourage more people to utilize the service.
2. Decrease fare amounts in rural cities.  People in rural cities may be more willing to utilize services if they arenâ€™t as expensive.
3. Increase fare amounts in urban cities.
